# Uncertainty-Quantification-Using-Monte-Carlo-Simulation

This code was developed in Sadeghi B (2020) Quantification of Uncertainty in Geochemical Anomalies in Mineral Exploration. PhD thesis, University of New South Wales.

This code is to apply to the classes obtained by different classification models (fractal models here), to quantify the uncertainty of each class/threshold, and compare the models based on that to select the most efficient and robust model.
