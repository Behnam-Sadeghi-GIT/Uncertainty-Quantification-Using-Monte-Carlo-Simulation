# Uncertainty-Quantification-Using-Monte-Carlo-Simulation

This code was developed in this paper: Sadeghi and Cohen, 2020: Category-based fractal modelling: A novel model to integrate the geology into the data for more effective processing and interpretation.

This code is to apply to the classes obtained by different classification models (fractal models here), to quantify the uncertainty of each class/threshold, and compare the models based on that to select the most efficient and robust model.
